# Data Hint

Data hint provides information about expected internal data values of the program during a de- bugging section. The system iteratively executes the code, line-by-line, similar to a debugging tool such as PythonTu- tor [11]. When the system detects that a value of variable is incorrect, it pauses the execution of the program, and shows the difference between the expected value and the actual value.
